                I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and
                Engineering at Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram University of Science and
                Technology, with a minor in Data Science. My academic background
                has provided me with strong fundamentals in data structures,
                operating systems, and DBMS, along with hands-on experience in
                C++, Python, and web development technologies. I take pride in
                my academic achievements, including a CGPA of 7.25 and 95% marks
                in 12th grade. My passion for technology drives me to
                continuously learn and improve.
                <br />
                <br />
                Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of projects that
                have honed my full-stack development and machine learning
                skills. For instance, I developed and deployed a responsive tour
                and travel website using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS, optimizing it
                for user experience and performance. I also built a house price
                prediction model using machine learning algorithms, creating a
                user-friendly interface with Django. These experiences have
                equipped me with expertise in React, Django, MySQL, MongoDB, and
                various web technologies.
                <br />
                <br />
                Looking ahead, I am eager to advance my career by contributing
                to innovative tech solutions. My focus is on further developing
                my skills in AI, cloud computing, and software architecture. I
                am particularly interested in roles that challenge me to combine
                machine learning with full-stack development to create impactful
                applications that solve real-world problems.
